# Remote vs On-site: Team Satisfaction Study

This project analyzes employee satisfaction scores based on work location—remote vs on-site—using a simulated dataset of team survey results. The objective is to uncover trends that inform HR and organizational decision-making about hybrid work policies.

## 🔍 Objective

To compare average satisfaction scores between remote and on-site teams and explore potential differences in team support needs and tool usage.

## 📊 Dataset

This simulated dataset contains 30 entries with the following columns:

- `department`: Team or department name
- `tools_used`: Collaboration tools used (e.g., Zoom, Slack, Teams)
- `satisfaction_score`: Self-reported satisfaction (scale of 1–10)
- `support_tickets_last_month`: Number of help desk tickets submitted
- `on_site_or_remote`: Work mode (Remote or On-site)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Google Sheets  
- `=AVERAGEIF` formulas for segmented analysis  
- Custom bar chart to compare average scores  

## 📈 Analysis

- Used `AVERAGEIF` to calculate satisfaction scores based on work mode.
- Created a bar chart to visually compare averages for remote vs on-site staff.
- Identified key departments and tools used most frequently by each group.

## 🧠 Findings

- **Average On-site Satisfaction:** 7.7  
- **Average Remote Satisfaction:** 7.1  
- On-site workers reported slightly higher satisfaction scores on average.
- Most common tools included Zoom, Slack, Gmail, Teams, and Confluence.

## ✅ Conclusion

The difference in satisfaction between remote and on-site teams is relatively small but notable. Organizations could benefit from reviewing support strategies and tools to improve the remote work experience. Continued analysis across more teams and months may yield stronger insights.
